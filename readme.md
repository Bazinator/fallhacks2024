# Intergalactic Transmitter ðŸš€âœ¨

Welcome to the **Intergalactic Transmitter**, a web app where users can send messages across spacetime! ðŸŒŒ Based on the hackathon theme "Faster Than Light," this project allows users to communicate with other planets at the speed of light. While a lot of functionality is still a work-in-progress, this app represents our creative take on interplanetary communication.

---

## Project Overview

### ðŸ“œ **Concept**
The **Intergalactic Transmitter** simulates sending messages across vast distances in the galaxy, mimicking the time it takes for light to travel between planets. Users can choose their home base planet and send messages to other planets in the universe. 

**Note:** Users pay with credits to send more messages. Not implemented yet.

### ðŸ’¡ **Why this project?**
We are first-year Computer Science students, and this hackathon was both a challenge and a learning experience for us. While we couldn't implement everything we envisioned, this project helped us improve our coding and collaboration skills under tight deadlines!

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fallhacks2024.git
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd fallhacks2024
cd Client
cd our-app
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
npm install
```
Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
Once the server is up, open your browser and head to http://localhost:3000 to start exploring the galaxy!


Known Issues
