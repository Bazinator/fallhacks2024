# Intergalactic Transmitter 🚀✨

Welcome to the **Intergalactic Transmitter**, a web app where users can send messages across spacetime! 🌌 Based on the hackathon theme "Faster Than Light," this project allows users to communicate with other planets at the speed of light. While a lot of functionality is still a work-in-progress, this app represents our creative take on interplanetary communication.

---

## Project Overview

### 📜 **Concept**
The **Intergalactic Transmitter** simulates sending messages across vast distances in the galaxy, mimicking the time it takes for light to travel between planets. Users can choose their home base planet and send messages to other planets in the universe. 

**Note:** Users pay with credits to send more messages. This is a basic feature, and many additional features are planned for future development!

### 💡 **Why this project?**
We are first-year Computer Science students, and this hackathon was both a challenge and a learning experience for us. While we couldn't implement everything we envisioned, this project helped us improve our coding and collaboration skills under tight deadlines!

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fallhacks2024.git
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd fallhacks2024
cd Client
cd our-app
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
Copy code
npm install
```
Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
Once the server is up, open your browser and head to http://localhost:3000 to start exploring the galaxy!

###Features
##Implemented Features:
🌍 Planet Selection: Users can choose their home base planet when they log in.
💬 Messaging System: Send messages across planets (functionality is still basic).


##Planned Features:
🔒 User Authentication: Secure login system for users.
💸 Credit System: Users can pay for more credits to send additional messages.
🌠 Enhanced UI: Improve user experience with better visual elements.
🌌 Expanded Universe: More planets, better interactions between users across planets.
💡 Message Storage: Persist messages across sessions and users.


##Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: (Planned for future updates)
Database: (Planned for future updates)
Version Control: Git & GitHub

##Known Issues
Missing user authentication.
No animation for sending message.
No displaying of distance or time calculation.
Credits functionality is not fully implemented.
Messages do not persist across sessions yet.
UI is still in its early stages of development.
